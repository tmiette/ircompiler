<h1>Overview of Tatoo usage</h1>

<p>The easiest way to write an analyzer specification file for Tatoo is to
use the new Tatoo ebnf file format. An eclipse plugin for these file is
available.</p>

<p>Throught the writing of a specification file one can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>build a lexer</li>
  <li>build a complete lexer+parser analyzer</li>
  <li>produce an html document that describe the parser table (useful among
    other for teaching and students)</li>
</ul>

<p>The ebnf file is a made of <em>sections</em> which consist of the line
<code><em>name</em>:</code> followed by its content. The valid sections
are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>tokens</code> and <code>blanks</code> where the lexical part is
    given</li>
  <li><code>starts</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>versions</code> and
    <code>productions</code> which describe the grammar</li>
</ul>

<p>From the content of the ebnf file, Tatoo generates a lexer, a parser or
both.</p>

<p>Though the generated lexer and parser can be used directly (which is
advised if the analyzer is used in a small device), the glue between them,
semantic stack managment or AST generation can be generated using the tools
module of Tatoo. Its specification is given with an XML file or putting types
in the ebnf file (the latter is dicouraged since it prevents clean separation
between semantic and syntax).</p>

<p>The tools XML file consists in three kinds of directives:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the tag <code>rule</code> which links a lexer rule (regular expression)
    to a terminal; these directives are usually not needed with the ebnf
    format. They can also specify which rules bypass the rule selection
    system (this is the case by default for blanks) or rules that are only
    part of a token (for instance strings or comments)</li>
  <li>the tag <code>terminal</code> gives the type of terminal attributes
    (which is void by default);</li>
  <li>the tag <code>non-terminal</code> gives the type of non-terminal
    attributes (which is also void by default).</li>
</ul>
