Tatoo FEATURES

Features version 3.0 :

 Clean separation of lexer, parser, generated evaluators (tools)
 and generated AST (tools AST)
 
 - common features
 
   - specification (lexer, parser, tools) can use XML format or EBNF
   - lexer accepts blocking and non-blocking buffer, pull/push parser (Tutorial)
   
   - runtime support (share parser/lexer implementation) :
     at runtime SimpleLexer/SimpleParser for simple task,
     Lexer and Parser for more complex task. (Tutorial)
   - generation used enumeration (dual representation
     integer/object) used as input or output
   - lexer and parser used listener.
     

 - lexer
   - rules specified
     - using XML tags
     - using usual regex format (Tutorial)
     
   - rule as enumeration
   - ability to indicate a sub selection of
     matching rules (RuleActivator)
   - scanner implementation (Tutorial)
   - ability to inform the parser about
     reset() and close() (LifecycleHandler) ...
 
 - parser
   - BNF grammar with star, plus and optional. (Tutorial)
   - priority on terminal and production,
     associativity on terminal.
     production priority can be guessed.
   - ability to specify a version for a production
     and to choose version at runtime. (Tutorial)
   - three grammar analysis algorithms (lr, slr, lalr)
   - autodetection of useless non terminals
   - productions, terminals and non terminals as enums
   - plugable error recovery mechanism  (Tutorial)
 
 - tools
   - can specify type for terminal and non-terminal
   - standard error recovery mechanism implemented
   - auto-generated evaluator with star and plus views
     as java.util.List (Tutorial)
   - parser can inform the lexer about witch rule to accept
     (RuleActivator and lookaheads)
 
 - tools AST (Tutorial)
   - can specify type for terminal, generate a class
     for each production and an interface for each
     non-terminal
   - auto-detection of :
     - useless non-terminal
     - recursive productions
     - star and plus productions
   - typed and generic view of the same AST
   - generated visitor
   - XML and IO serialization/deserialization
